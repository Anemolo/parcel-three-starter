- [] How do I make sure build steps dopnt break with time.
- [] Utils
- [] Debug utilities
- [] yarn reference to absolute path -> ~
- [] Look into initVars and initPage

  - [x] Texture

## Static files

They can iether be in /static or /dist/static
Both are pushed to the codebase and putting them in /static means parcel dosn't have to copy them over

Notes:
Sometimes git doesn't ignore files because they are already tracked in teh repositoruy
